# Dice roller files

> These files are used as exampkes in teaching. The aim is to move from familiar procedural python to event driven JavaScript:
## diceriller1.py

This contains a the basic input of a dice ype choice (i.e. a 4, 6 or 12 sided dice) and outputs a random number to mimic the use of that type of dice. It runs once

## diceroller2.py

This improves **diceroller1.py** improved by adding a loop to allow repeating the rolling process and make it slightly more user freindly

## diceroller1.html

This uses html as a user interface and introduces the use of a button to call a function rolling a dice. It intoduces the event driven concept, but the function mimics the earler python code though the use of ```prompt()`` instread of python's ```input()``` and ```alert()``` to replace python's ```print()```.

## diceroller2.html

This adds a ```select`` dropdown form element to eliminate user input errors in the use of ```prompt()``` and outputs to a test box instead of using ```alert```.
